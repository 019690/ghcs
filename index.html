    <!--== YOUR STORY==-->
    <section class="your-story">
      <img src="./assets/ys.JPG" alt="" height="">
      <div class="ys-content">
        <h1>Your story starts here</h1>
        <!-- <img src="./assets/your story.jpg" alt="" height="500"> -->
        <p>Quality relationships, abundance, career growth, getting ahead in life, financial stability and wealth
          creation,
          entrepreneurship, leadership at work, and good health, among all other things you desire, depending on how
          well you know
          yourself.
          <br>
          From experience, I have learned that negative situations keep recurring until we gain self-awareness to help
          us make
          helpful decisions. Self-awareness does not mean that you will not have failures. It means you will fail
          forward, failing
          into growth and unlocking new potential, growing, succeeding.
          <br>
          You want to be happy. You want to be successful. You have dreams and goals. You crave change. You are not yet
          where you
          know you would love to be, and the journey ahead leaves you worried, unsure, and even afraid.
          <br>
          Perhaps you feel doubtful of your abilities which makes you second-guess yourself. Maybe you would like to
          speak up
          more, but you are always last to speak; perhaps you only speak when prompted or hardly speak when it matters
          the most.
          Maybe you struggle to say no. Perhaps, it is your relationships that could use some new direction.
          <br>
          Fact, you are not the only one with similar issues. Fact, you can overcome each of the challenges positively.
          <br>
          Growth is hardly painless; living on your terms requires courage and self-confidence. While happiness is a
          choice, joy
          requires deliberate attention to who you are, and for this, you need self-awareness.
          <br>
        <h2>But then you ask,</h2>
        <br>
        What if I fail?
        <br>
        What if I embarrass myself?
        <br>
        What if people I value disapprove of my decision?
        <br>
        What if I cannot manage on my own?
        <br>
        What if I am wrong?
        <br>
        <h2>It is time to get past the "what ifs."</h2>
        <br>
        Overcoming fear, procrastination, self-doubt, limiting beliefs, lack of inspiration, and eventually getting
        unstuck
        requires action.
        You might have taken action, but the step needed to be bolder to create movement in the right direction. You
        might have
        taken action but with a mindset and habits that keep you more in the past than you realize. You might even
        have made the
        wrong move.
        However, if you dig deeper into your actions, thoughts, decisions, and patterns, you will uncover the barriers
        and can
        begin your healing and transformation journey.
        Transformation means questioning everything you know and believe. It is uncomfortable, challenging, and
        rewarding. It is
        the way to build self-confidence, resilience, self-love, positive habits, and self-discipline.

            <span>goal selection</span>
            <p>Goals should be a source of motivation that incentivize you to action, satisfaction, and pleasure, help
              you define your
              ideal life, and support the comparison between the progress made and the best-case scenario you desire.
              The coaching
              process will support you in identifying your short-term, long-term, and learning goals with clarity.</p>

            <p>Here, the intention is to get you to an implementational mindset to help you focus on success rather than
              the
              possibility of failure. Successful identification and implementation of the action plans depend on your
              readiness to

            <p>This process comes from the appreciation that in life, you will always have challenges and that
              successful coaching
              empowers you to identify ways that make you resilient, allowing you to implement what you have learned
              when you
              experience challenges in the future and helping you nurture your well-being regardless of the
              circumstances in your

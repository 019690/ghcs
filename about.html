      <h2>Your coach</h2>
      <p>Eve Muchiri is a transformation life coach specializing in growth and self-awareness from the understanding
        that
        healing, success, self-love, peace, and joy begin from self-awareness.
        Achieving self-awareness means that you understand your strengths, weaknesses, motivations, blind spots, and
        triggers
        well enough to shape your thoughts and beliefs in ways that empower you to have a life that is yours, a life
        that you
        are proud of.</p>
      <p>
        Eve uses practical, simple, and relatable coaching techniques and tools that will guide you to discover who you
        are, why
        you are who you are, why you think and behave as you do, and to empower you come up with the most optimal
        solutions to
        challenges and opportunities in your various areas of your life.
      </p>
      <p>Eve coaches because she is passionate about improving people's lives in simple, practical, and accessible ways.
        She has
        learnt how to get moving and recover well from setbacks through everyday activities such as mustering the
        discipline to
        run, transitioning from a successful sales career to life coaching, creating boundaries and saying no, and
        learning how
        to ask for help, among other marginal improvements in her personal and work life that have given her hands-on
        experience
        to support her work as a Transformation Life Coach.</p>
      <p>
        Eve has a natural aptitude for coaching due to her critical thinking abilities, empathy, enthusiasm, and
        positivity
        toward life. Her experience in sales and marketing exposed her to dynamic environments that require quick
        thinking and a
        solution-oriented mindset, and numerous interpersonal relationships that have made her non-judgemental,
        personable,
        mindful, bold, and open-minded.</p>

      <p>Transformative life coaching is Eve, and Eve is transformative life coaching. It is close to her heart.</p>

      <h2>biggest barrier to change and transformation</h2>
      <p>Comfort zones are tempting to choose because change is not easy.
        The discomfort in challenging yourself is the biggest barrier because the coaching process is more internal than
        it is
        external. Accepting that the transformation process will have some painful moments and not running away from the
        pain of
        growth cannot be easy. Remaining truthful with yourself about where you are and what you need to do to get the
        goals and
        dreams you desire is difficult.
        But,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> if you are ready to have different results in your life,</li>
        <li>if you are ready to show up as the person you know you are and can be if you were not afraid and
          self-sabotaging,</li>
        <li> if you are ready to build your confidence and self-esteem,</li>
        <li> if you are ready to have a beautiful and loving relationship with yourself and others,</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        the transformation journey you are about to begin will be life changing and every challenge along the way worth
        it.</p>
